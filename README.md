Accident Analysis Dashboard – Tableau
Problem Statement:
Accidents cause significant economic losses and impact public safety. Understanding accident trends, causes, and high-risk zones is crucial for authorities to implement effective safety measures. A data-driven approach can help identify patterns and reduce future incidents.

Description:
This Accident Analysis Dashboard in Tableau visualizes accident data to uncover key insights such as:

Accident Trends – Monthly, weekly, and hourly distribution of accidents.
High-Risk Locations – Identifies accident-prone areas using geospatial mapping.
Causes & Contributing Factors – Analyzes factors like weather, road conditions, and driver behavior.
Severity Analysis – Classifies accidents by severity (minor, major, fatal).
Vehicle & Demographics Insights – Breaks down accident data by vehicle type and driver demographics.
By leveraging interactive dashboards, stakeholders (governments, insurers, transportation agencies) can make informed decisions, improve road safety policies, and optimize resource allocation.
